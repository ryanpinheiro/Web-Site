    <h1>Best Horror Games</h1>
    <h2>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</h2>
    <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/jhG1TUq.jpg" alt="Amenesia">
    <p> <br> Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a first-person survival horror game. The developer, Frictional Games, also
        worked on Penumbra, another game of the style that was consecrated by its atmosphere. <br>

        <br> In the game, you play as a protagonist who wakes up with amnesia in a mysterious castle, with the strange
        sensation of being chased. The player must discover information about the past and prevent future events from
        happening. <br>

        <br> The great thing about the game is mental health. The player must avoid going through depressive and obscure
        environments to keep himself balanced. In addition, when being encountered by an enemy, or participating in
        bizarre events, your mental health is profoundly affected, resulting in unpleasant effects. <br>

        <br> There is no combat system, and the player must just run and hide in the gaps in the environment. The title
        also features a series of different puzzles that make use of steam engines, gears and other elements of style.
        Amnesia: The Dark Descent is available for PC, Linux and Mac. <br>

        alt="Love Sam">
    <p><br> Written with love... and something much worse.<br>

        <br> This room holds your biggest fears... and a diary. Its every page describes heartfelt feelings for a boy,
        and what happened 3 years ago in a small town of Rosen Peek.<br>

        <br> Maybe none of those things matter to you. Nonetheless, you must read through the mystery diary to keep on
        moving with your life. However, unknown horror grows within the walls as the past catches up with you and a
        sweet love story turns into a tale of madness.<br>

        <br> So sit down, and start reading. <br>

    <h3>environment</h3>
    <p><br>The game is set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. You’ll wander through the gloomy
        corridors, explore every dead room, and get lost in endless mazes, your head filling with memories of the dead
        families that once lived in this very home. This twisted environment, void of any life other than yours, takes
        you to places you couldn't even bear imagining.<br></p>

    <h3>Storyline</h3>
    <p>This house is stained with a terrible past. Families were brutally murdered by their own family members, people
        went insane, many committed suicide, and other grisly events occurred. Each and every room has its story painted
        on an invisible canvas. As a player, you will relive parts of this dark past, and each of its fragments will
        leave you restless and terrified. You’ll soon wish you could join the dead's ranks in their abyss, but death
        won't help you leave this place. Will you run from it, or will you try to uncover the truth behind the shadows?
        <br>
